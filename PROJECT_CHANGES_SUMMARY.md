## 6. Technical Implementation Details

### CSS Animations Used
```css
/* Scan Lines */
@keyframes scan {
    0% { transform: translateY(0); }
    100% { transform: translateY(10px); }
}

/* Holographic Overlay */
@keyframes holographic {
    0% { transform: translateX(-100%); }
    100% { transform: translateX(100%); }
}

/* Glitch Effect */
@keyframes glitch {
    0%, 100% { filter: brightness(1) hue-rotate(0deg); }
    20% { filter: brightness(1.2) hue-rotate(5deg); transform: scale(1.05) translateX(2px); }
    40% { filter: brightness(0.9) hue-rotate(-5deg); transform: scale(1.05) translateX(-2px); }
    60% { filter: brightness(1.1) hue-rotate(2deg); transform: scale(1.05) translateY(1px); }
}
```

### Responsive Design
- All slides adapt to mobile devices
- Grid layouts switch from multi-column to single column
- Font sizes and spacing adjust for smaller screens
- Images maintain aspect ratio and scale appropriately

### Performance Optimizations
- Images use `loading="lazy"` attribute
- CSS animations use GPU-accelerated properties
- Backdrop filters for glassmorphism effects

## 7. Video Playback Investigation and Canvas Animation Solution

### Issue Discovery
During the implementation of the video encounter slide, it was discovered that `giantsquid.mp4` is a Git LFS (Large File Storage) pointer file rather than the actual video file. This prevented the video from playing in the browser.

### Investigation Process
1. **Initial Problem**: Video element showed black screen with no playback
2. **File Analysis**: Discovered the MP4 file was only 134 bytes - a Git LFS pointer
3. **LFS Pointer Content**: File contains Git LFS metadata instead of video data:
   ```
   version https://git-lfs.github.com/spec/v1
   oid sha256:hash_value
   size actual_file_size
   ```

### Canvas Animation Fallback Solution
To provide a visual experience despite the missing video, a sophisticated canvas animation was implemented featuring:

#### Animation Components
1. **Animated Squid**:
   - Central squid body with gradient coloring (dark blue to cyan)
   - 8 animated tentacles with sinusoidal wave motion
   - Each tentacle has unique phase offset for natural movement
   - Tentacles drawn with bezier curves for smooth, organic shapes

2. **Particle System**:
   - 50 floating particles simulating marine snow/debris
   - Varying sizes and speeds for depth perception
   - Particles fade in/out and wrap around screen edges
   - Creates atmospheric underwater environment

3. **Light Ray Effects**:
   - 5 animated light rays emanating from top
   - Dynamic opacity changes (0.02 to 0.1)
   - Rotating angles create sweeping searchlight effect
   - Simulates ROV lights searching the depths

4. **Visual Enhancements**:
   - Dark gradient background (#0a0a0a to #1a1a2e)
   - Subtle glow effects on squid and particles
   - Smooth 60 FPS animation using requestAnimationFrame
   - Responsive canvas sizing

### Diagnostic Tools Created

#### 1. `test_video_access.html`
A diagnostic page to verify video file issues:
- Tests direct video playback
- Displays file metadata and error messages
- Confirms Git LFS pointer status
- Provides clear error reporting

#### 2. `placeholder_video_generator.html`
A tool for creating placeholder videos:
- Generates WebM format videos using MediaRecorder API
- Creates animated canvas content
- Allows customizable duration
- Provides downloadable video files

### Implementation Details
The canvas animation is integrated into `video_encounter_slide.html` with:
- Automatic initialization on page load
- Full viewport coverage
- Seamless integration with existing slide navigation
- Performance-optimized rendering loop

### Instructions for Obtaining Real Video
To get the actual video file instead of the Git LFS pointer:
1. Ensure Git LFS is installed: `git lfs install`
2. Pull the actual video file: `git lfs pull`
3. This will download the real `giantsquid.mp4` file
4. The video element will then work as originally intended

### Technical Benefits
- **No Dependencies**: Pure JavaScript canvas animation
- **Lightweight**: No external libraries required
- **Performance**: Optimized rendering with minimal CPU usage
- **Fallback**: Provides engaging visuals even without video file
- **Educational**: Demonstrates advanced canvas animation techniques

## 8. Color Scheme
- Primary: #00E5FF (Cyan)
- Secondary: #81C784 (Light Green)
- Accent: #FF4500 (Orange Red)
- Background: Various gradients using #0A0E27, #1A237E, #0D1421

## 9. Files Modified/Created
1. `research_vessels_slide.html` - Enhanced with images and effects
2. `journey_map_slide.html` - Created new
3. `species_info_slide.html` - Created new
4. `encounter_slide.html` - Updated content
5. `index.html` - Navigation updated
6. `research_vessels_image_plan.md` - Planning document created
7. `video_encounter_slide.html` - Created with canvas animation fallback

## Future Considerations

- Removed slides are preserved as comments and can be restored if needed
- All visual effects are CSS-based for easy customization
- Real video can be obtained using `git lfs pull` command
